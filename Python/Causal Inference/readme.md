# Description
This notebook is a tutorial on how to build a **Synthetic Control Sample** generated by Linear Regression to assess the impact of the opening of a competitor over sales.

## Requirements
"causalimpact>=0.2.6",
"ipykernel>=6.29.5",
"matplotlib>=3.10.0",
"numpy==1.26.4",
"pandas>=2.2.3",
"pingouin>=0.5.5",
"scikit-learn>=1.6.0",
"scipy>=1.14.1",

## Note
If you get the error that pandas core does not have the method `pd.core.dtypes.common.is_datetime_or_timedelta_dtype`, open the **analysis.py** file from the `causalimpact` library and change it to the newer method `is_datetime64_any_dtype`
